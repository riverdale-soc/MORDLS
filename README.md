# MORDLS: Man Over-Board Remote Detection and Localization System.

MORDLS is a system that is designed to increase detection rate and decrease search time in man-overboard rescue responses. To increase and minimize latency in man overboard (MOB) detection we designed a battery powered, waterproof wearable device that detects submersion of a person, and propagates a wake command and real time GPS coordinates of the victim to the deck.
